====================================================================
 Krzysztof Wilczynski <krzysztof.wilczynski@linux.com> (120):
  * Re-factor of the code to make it more Puppet-friendly and update of the
    short documentation in the comment lines.
  * Fix to a type in the documentation.
  * Re-factor. Removed not needed shebang for Ruby.
  * Fix. Given vim mode line should end with : in order to work.
  * Fix. Should yield empty data structure when given key cannot be found in
    the hash upon parsing YAML file.
  * Fix. The data structure should only be populated and/or set to be empty
    if and only if key is present.
  * Small re-factor.
  * Check for the number of arguments given.
  * Small re-factor.
  * Changing the name of the file to reflect change in the function name.
  * Changing the way how function description and usage was given.  Now
    documentation is exposed properly via Puppet itself.
  * First version.
  * Adding README file ...
  * Changing the name of the file to reflect change in the function name.
  * Create destination directory on-demand i.e. when missing ...
  * Minor changes. Added placeholder for :doc in Puppet's newfunction to fill
    later.
  * First version.  A function for Puppet that allows to retrieve a fact from
    Facter easily instead of resorting to awful "inline_template"
    use-and-abuse practices.
  * We do not need cronrand.rb any more.
  * Small changes.  Mainly to formatting of the help provided.
  * Fix.  It is better to promote good practice...
  * First version.  Adding join to Puppet for use within the manifest files.
  * First version.  Function that allows to collect selected indices from an
    array within Puppet manifest.  More or less how array slicing works in
    Perl ...
  * Small changes.  Added better error checking etc ...
  * Adding ability to specifiy range as the index when selecting indices to
    collect.
  * Adding more error checking ...
  * Updated error check and reporting.  Also we now return empty string value
    i.e. "" instead of raising an exception when a particular fact is not
    present.  We also make use of strinterp() explicitly to evaluate
    arguments passed to the function.
  * Update to error reporting.
  * Updated help message.
  * Added help accessible via the :doc functionality in Puppet's newfunction.
  * First version.  Improvment upon bool2num function found on the Internet.
  * Minor update.
  * First version.  Function opposite to the bool2num one.  Converts number
    to appropriate boolean value.
  * Small re-factor of fact function.
  * Changing name of join.rb to join_with_prefix.rb to make room for its
    simpler version.
  * Small re-factor to fact function.
  * First version.  Simple join function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple prefix function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * Re-factor of the original function.  Now its behaviour is either to join
    with prefix or just add prefix or simply join.  This depends on its use.
  * First version.  Simple empty function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple count function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple include function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple reverse function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple shuffle function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple unique function to use within Puppet DSL.

  * Small re-factor.  We prefer our local clone of the array ...
  * First version.  Simple delete_at function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * Changing name of collect_indices.rb to values_at.rb in order to be
    reasemble Ruby's Array#values_at more.  Added support for ranges with
    hyphen, two and three dots notation.
  * Removing surplus files.
  * Changed comment line wording.
  * Removing string interpolation from fact.rb.  I am not sure whether we
    should fiddle with this.  The old behaviour e.g. evaluate when inside ""
    and don't do anything when inside '' is probably better choice in the end
    as people are used to it working that way.
  * First version.  Simple range function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * Changing name of the function from include to includes as it clashes with
    a core function from Puppet::Parser.  I had no idea that you can
    over-write some of the that way. Oops.
  * Minor changes.
  * First version.  Simple is_array function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple is_string function to use within Puppet DSL.

  * Added TODO for future reference.
  * Added TODO for future reference.

  * Adding support for string alongside arrays.
  * First version.  Simple type function to use within Puppet DSL.

  * Small re-factor of shuffle function.  It is more compact now.
  * Added support for strings to reverse.
  * First version.  Simple strip function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple rstrip function to use within Puppet DSL.

  * Adding support for strings and hashes to the function empty.
  * Make sure that we have string-encoded integer value.
  * Adding support for strings to the the function unique.
  * Adding TODO for future reference.
  * Added FalseClass and TrueClass to be identified as Boolean to the type
    function.
  * Added proper handling of both FalseClass and TrueClass.  We also return
    real integer values now over string-encoded integers.
  * Reverting name back to bool2num.
  * First version.  Simple str2bool function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * Minor changes.
  * Added check to ensure that given fact name is a string.
  * Minor change.
  * Renaming from includes to member in order to avoid confusion and
    possibility of a clash with Puppet built-in function include.
  * Renaming the file from includes.rb to member.rb.
  * Removing old file includes.rb

  * Moved to unless from if not and changed wording of few error messages.
  * Added ability to flatten the resulting array in the function zip. This
    would allow for creating hashes on the fly from two arrays.
  * Now prefix will convert everything into string which is the same as join
    would do.  Also function is now more robust in error detection.
  * Function has now more robust error detection.
  * Corrected function name from chop to strip.  Moved to unless from if not
    to improve code clarity.
  * Added comment line.
  * Added comment line.
  * Small change to code formatting.
  * Moved to unless from if not to make code more clear.  Plus a variable
    name change for simplicity.
  * Added TODO for future reference.

    future reference.  Changed wording of few error messages.

 Krzysztof Wilczynski <krzysztof.wilczynski@linux.com> (120):
  * Re-factor of the code to make it more Puppet-friendly and update of the
    short documentation in the comment lines.
  * Fix to a type in the documentation.
  * Re-factor. Removed not needed shebang for Ruby.
  * Fix. Given vim mode line should end with : in order to work.
  * Fix. Should yield empty data structure when given key cannot be found in
    the hash upon parsing YAML file.
  * Fix. The data structure should only be populated and/or set to be empty
    if and only if key is present.
  * Small re-factor.
  * Check for the number of arguments given.
  * Small re-factor.
  * Changing the name of the file to reflect change in the function name.
  * Changing the way how function description and usage was given.  Now
    documentation is exposed properly via Puppet itself.
  * First version.
  * Adding README file ...
  * Changing the name of the file to reflect change in the function name.
  * Create destination directory on-demand i.e. when missing ...
  * Minor changes. Added placeholder for :doc in Puppet's newfunction to fill
    later.
  * First version.  A function for Puppet that allows to retrieve a fact from
    Facter easily instead of resorting to awful "inline_template"
    use-and-abuse practices.
  * We do not need cronrand.rb any more.
  * Small changes.  Mainly to formatting of the help provided.
  * Fix.  It is better to promote good practice...
  * First version.  Adding join to Puppet for use within the manifest files.
  * First version.  Function that allows to collect selected indices from an
    array within Puppet manifest.  More or less how array slicing works in
    Perl ...
  * Small changes.  Added better error checking etc ...
  * Adding ability to specifiy range as the index when selecting indices to
    collect.
  * Adding more error checking ...
  * Updated error check and reporting.  Also we now return empty string value
    i.e. "" instead of raising an exception when a particular fact is not
    present.  We also make use of strinterp() explicitly to evaluate
    arguments passed to the function.
  * Update to error reporting.
  * Updated help message.
  * Added help accessible via the :doc functionality in Puppet's newfunction.
  * First version.  Improvment upon bool2num function found on the Internet.
  * Minor update.
  * First version.  Function opposite to the bool2num one.  Converts number
    to appropriate boolean value.
  * Small re-factor of fact function.
  * Changing name of join.rb to join_with_prefix.rb to make room for its
    simpler version.
  * Small re-factor to fact function.
  * First version.  Simple join function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple prefix function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * Re-factor of the original function.  Now its behaviour is either to join
    with prefix or just add prefix or simply join.  This depends on its use.
  * First version.  Simple empty function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple count function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple include function to use within Puppet DSL.

  * First version.  Simple delete_at function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * Changing name of collect_indices.rb to values_at.rb in order to be
    reasemble Ruby's Array#values_at more.  Added support for ranges with
    hyphen, two and three dots notation.
  * Removing surplus files.
  * Changed comment line wording.
  * Removing string interpolation from fact.rb.  I am not sure whether we
    should fiddle with this.  The old behaviour e.g. evaluate when inside ""
    and don't do anything when inside '' is probably better choice in the end
    as people are used to it working that way.
  * First version.  Simple range function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * Changing name of the function from include to includes as it clashes with
    a core function from Puppet::Parser.  I had no idea that you can
    over-write some of the that way. Oops.
  * Minor changes.
  * First version.  Simple is_array function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * First version.  Simple is_string function to use within Puppet DSL.

  * Make sure that we have string-encoded integer value.
  * Adding support for strings to the the function unique.
  * Adding TODO for future reference.
  * Added FalseClass and TrueClass to be identified as Boolean to the type
    function.
  * Added proper handling of both FalseClass and TrueClass.  We also return
    real integer values now over string-encoded integers.
  * Reverting name back to bool2num.
  * First version.  Simple str2bool function to use within Puppet DSL.
  * Minor changes.
  * Added check to ensure that given fact name is a string.
  * Minor change.
  * Renaming from includes to member in order to avoid confusion and
    possibility of a clash with Puppet built-in function include.

  * Moved to unless from if not and changed wording of few error messages.
  * Added ability to flatten the resulting array in the function zip. This
    would allow for creating hashes on the fly from two arrays.
  * Now prefix will convert everything into string which is the same as join
    would do.  Also function is now more robust in error detection.
  * Function has now more robust error detection.
  * Corrected function name from chop to strip.  Moved to unless from if not
    to improve code clarity.
  * Added comment line.
  * Added comment line.

    name change for simplicity.
